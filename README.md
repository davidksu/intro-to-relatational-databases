# intro-to-relatational-databases
In this project, you will use PostgreSQL Database, IBM Db2 Database, and MySQL. These are all relational database management systems (RDBMS) designed to efficiently store, manipulate, and retrieve the data.  These RDBMS services are available as part of IBM SN Labs Cloud IDE. IBM Skills Network Labs (SN Labs) is a virtual lab environment used in this course.
